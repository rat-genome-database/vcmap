- RGD could change gene position every week
- RGD / ISU maps won't change often, but annotation will
- Suggest that the VCMap frontend has its own data warehouse
  - Pull data from ISU/MCW
- Aligning the Maps - possible options out there
  - Compara (Ensembl)
  - UCSC orthologs
  - NCBI orthologs
  - In paranoid (not up to date often)
  + Problem with them is they all use genomic maps, not RH
  + 20-25% of the RH Maps (SSLPs) don't map back to Genomic coords
- Start tool with two options, Ensembl or NCBI
  - Chooses all data, sequence and annotation
  - Don't try to map
- Linkage maps?
  - Don't hook up between the two
  - Ex] Rat Linkage -> Rat Seq -> Human Seq -> Human Linkage
- Store Map data for each elements
  - RHMap: Name (RHMap), Map ID, positions
  - Genomic Map: Assembly, positions
- QTLs might have just primers... need manual mapping
+ Mary, Julienne will be getting a QTL dataset together for me
