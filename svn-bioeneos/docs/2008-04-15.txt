What is all of the required functionality that we *must* retain?
(Map loading, QTL loading, Zooming, Linking out, Draw marker links)
(Launch from a webpage?)



For maps that do not share any marker data, should we infer an approximate translation by comparing total map sizes?



Are any Synteny relationships stored in Homologene?



Were F/P/Bin markers generated manually in the original VCMap?



List and decide on sources of data for all maps:
(Genetic, Cytogenetic, Genome, RH, QTL)
